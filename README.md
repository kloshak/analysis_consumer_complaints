Analysis of US Consumer Financial Complaints from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)

The CFPB is an agency of the United States government responsible for consumer protection in the financial sector.

The CFPB has a core mission that drives its activities: “ensure… that markets for consumer financial products and services are fair, transparent, and competitive”. The financial transactions which are its primary concerns are consumer mortgages, personal loans and credit (covering student loans, credit cards, payday lenders and other small credit suppliers).

The financial institutions under the Bureau’s jurisdiction include banks and credit unions with total assets over $10 billion, mortgage lenders, and any other consumer financial entity the CFPB considers important within consumer financial services.
